This document details the file directories used by iris, as well as how they are used.


The directory /iris/ is the parent dir for all sub directories.

Under /iris/ there are two types of sub directories:

1) The resource directory
    Location: /iris/resources/
        This is where the global resources are location.
        Currently, the only global resources is the global list of aliases, aliases.json.
            This json has the scheme:

                <todo insert json scheme />

2) The user directory
    Assume a registered user has the ethereum account id <a>. Then for each user, the following
    directories are created:

        /iris/<a>/inbox/

        /iris/<a>/uploads/private
        
        /iris/<a>/uploads/public
